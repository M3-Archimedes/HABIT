# HABIT: H3 Aggregation-based Imputation Framework for Vessel Trajectories


HABIT Framework  provides a valuable means to impute the missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing such patterns over historical AIS data.
HABIT provides  an efficient, data-driven and scalable approach for gap imputation relying on spatial aggregates of AIS positional reports computed over H3 hexagon cells.
